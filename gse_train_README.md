The Group Size Estimator (GSE) Training Blueprint provides an end-to-end framework for finetuning object counter models on custom image datasets. This Bleurprint lets the user finetune a pre-trained YOLOv5 model on custom data and then use it to perform inference and batch predictions. Complete the following steps to run this blueprint:

1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button.
2. Select a suitable Compute Template to run the blueprint libraries.
3. Enter and/or edit input arguments to the blueprint libraries and save the changes. Refer to the documentation pages of libraries for more details.
4. Click the **Run** button to launch the end-to-end framework.
5. Once the inference endpoint is ready, use either the Try it Live feature or the Integration panel to integrate the endpoint into your code.

Note: This blueprint may launch multiple experiments with the same title while performing hyperparameter optimization. The best-performing model is selected based on the average precision score metric.
